# Ansible Configuration Management Project

This project demonstrates how to use Ansible for configuration management on a macOS system. It automates the setup process for installing Ansible and its dependencies, as well as creating project directories and files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your macOS system:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): Package manager for macOS.
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/): Automation tool for configuration management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ansible-conc
    ```

3. Execute the Ansible playbook:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini config.yml
    ```

This will run the Ansible playbook, which will install Ansible dependencies, Ansible itself, and create necessary project directories and files.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to install software packages and create directories on your system.
- Modify the playbook (`config.yml`) and inventory (`inventory.ini`) files as needed to suit your requirements.
